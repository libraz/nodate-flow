-- Nullable columns inside unique keys.
--
-- The soft-delete rule next door leans on one property of MySQL: an
-- index entry containing NULL is never a duplicate, which is what lets a
-- tombstone leave the index while live rows stay unique. The property
-- has no idea it is being used on purpose. It applies to every nullable
-- column in every unique key, and where the key was written to bind
-- something it quietly binds nothing for exactly the rows that carry a
-- NULL there.
--
-- That failure is invisible from the schema. `UNIQUE (workspace_id,
-- project_id, name)` reads as "one label of this name per scope" and is
-- one of two completely different rules depending on a nullability three
-- lines above it: for project-scoped labels it holds, and for
-- workspace-wide ones — where project_id IS NULL, and which is most of
-- them — a workspace may hold any number of live labels with the same
-- name. Nothing errors, nothing logs, and the conflict error the API
-- already defines for that case simply never fires.
--
-- So a nullable column in a unique key is a decision, and this file
-- makes it a written one. Two shapes are legitimate:
--
--   Partial uniqueness — the key is meant to be inert for the NULL
--   rows, because those rows have no identity to collide on. A calendar
--   with no provider slug is not a duplicate of another calendar with no
--   provider slug; a webhook test ping stands for no event and is a new
--   dispatch every time. The key constrains the subset that does have an
--   identity, and NULL is how a row says it is not in that subset.
--
--   Disjoint pairs — two keys over two mutually exclusive row kinds,
--   with a CHECK constraint deciding which. Each key binds the kind
--   whose column is set and goes inert for the other. reactions,
--   storage_objects and task_actors are all this shape: every row is
--   covered by exactly one of the two keys, and coverage is complete
--   only because the CHECK forbids the row that would fall through both.
--
-- Anything else is the labels case: a key that claims a constraint and
-- does not have it. The fix is not a sentinel in the base column, which
-- would break the foreign key and lie about the data, but a generated
-- column that names the value instead of carrying NULL — the same
-- device calendar_events.task_singleton_role uses, and what
-- labels.scope_project_id, lenses.scope_project_id and
-- user_view_preferences.scope_key are for.

-- The set that needs justifying: every nullable column sitting in a
-- unique index.
--
-- `active` is excluded because the rule above already pins it. It has to
-- be a nullable generated column derived from enabled and nothing else
-- may be named `active`, so a liveness marker cannot reach this check
-- and no other column can arrive wearing its name.
--
-- Identifiers are copied into utf8mb4_bin so every comparison below is
-- between two columns of this file's own making. information_schema
-- carries its own collation, and joining a temporary table straight
-- against it is an illegal mix of collations on some builds.
